Django Rest Framework + React
=============================
Example code for the tutorial found at [geezhawk.github.io](http://geezhawk.github.io/using-react-with-django-rest-framework).

To try it yourself, clone the repo and run:

* `npm install`
* `npm run webpack`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python manage.py runserver`

Todo
1) High priority
    * get prod api key / apply to contest
    * improve match history (add players to Backend)
    * fix bad role readings -> default to a popular page for another role if no info available
    * title the your rune / popular rune panels
    * write DOCUMENTATION!

2) Low Priority
    * dynamic slides (filter matches by current champ)
    * better rune descriptions (scrape / copy from opgg)
    * Cleanup css for primary/secondary pages (merge into 1 panel)?
    * New page -> view popular runes for a champion from some champion list..
